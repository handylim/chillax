In junior high I was involved in track and field, I was in the choir, and I played the baritone.  In ninth grade, I dropped out of all three because I didnâ€™t feel like I could handle them.  During the next three years I isolated myself.",

During this time I came close to agoraphobia, which is the fear of leaving your house or being in open places. But I found help by starting counseling and later, with medications. This was extremely difficult for me. It was humbling to know that I couldnâ€™t fix myself on my own. People were not always encouraging. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",
